  Background

%p
  The city of Thornbare suffers under the rule of the dread Hand of the Chained
  God, whose servitors, the hideous dog-headed creatures known as Hundkin, have
  imposed strict laws governing every aspect of the citizens' lives. Weapons
  have been outlawed, and luxury goods have been seized. Even the basics needed
  to survive are increasingly hard to come by.

%p
  Your party of adventurers was hired by a shady Tiefling named Tarantel to
  supply the Night Market, a periodic event held in great secrecy once a month,
  with contraband goods. The market is being held this very night, and it's your
  job to gather resources and get them to the Night Market while evading the
  Hand patrols and the attention of the city guard that is in their thrall.

%p
  Your reward from Tarantel depends on delivering the maximum amount of contraband
  with the minimum amount of attention. You will need to keep your wits about
  you to succeed.

  Rules

%ul

  %li
    You start the game in The Bottoms, the depressing slum that rises in the
    shadow of Thornbare's outer wall. You have three random resource cards in
    your hand.

  %li
    To move around the board, you roll a die. You may only move forward.

  %li
    When you land on a named location, for example The Trifle, you draw a card.
    The card may be a resource, an ally, a distraction, or an encounter.

  %li
    Each time you pass The Bottoms on the board, you gain a resource card.

  %li
    If you land on a square occupied by another player, you may trade one card
    to the other player.

  %li
    Allies can be selected to assist you in an encounter. The value on the upper
    left of the selected ally card represents the number of additional dice you
    roll in the encounter.

  %li
    Distractions may be selected instead of an ally in an encounter. The value on
    the distraction card represents the number of dice that will be removed from
    your opponent's dice pool. Distractions are discarded once the encounter is
    over.

  %li
    Encounters have a value representing the number of dice in your opponent's
    dice pool. Regardless of any reductions from playing a distraction card,
    you and your opponent will always roll at least one die.

  %li
    If you win an encounter, or if you and your opponent roll the same value,
    you preserve all of your resources and play resumes. If you lose an
    encounter, you lose a number of resources equal to the encounter value. If
    you played an ally card in the encounter and lose, that ally is discarded.

  %li
    At any point after circling the board #{Game::MINIMUM_TRIPS_TO_ENABLE_ENDGAME}
    times, you may on your turn opt to enter the sewers, which serve as the
    entrance to the Night Market. This triggers the final encounter. If you
    win the final encounter, congratulations! Your accumulated resources will
    be put on the market and you will earn a reward from Tarantel. If you lose
    the final encounter, none of your resources will make it to the Night Market
    and you will be out of the game.

  %li
    The game is over when all players have attempted to enter the Night Market.
