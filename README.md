# About Thornbare
Thornbare is a multi-player, turn-based board game. The goal of the game is to
amass resources and escort them to the entrance of the black market. Along the
way players draw cards representing additional resources, allies, and distractions.
They may also draw Encounter cards, which result in a confrontation with a
Hand patrol.

This is a cooperative game. The final score reflects all the players' resources
that made it successfully to the black market entrance.

# Setup
