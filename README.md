# About Thornbare
Thornbare is a multi-player, turn-based board game. The goal of the game is to
amass resources and escort them to the entrance to the sewers beneath the
city of Thornbare, where the Night Market is held.

Along the way players draw cards representing additional resources, allies, and
distractions. They may also draw Encounter cards, which result in a confrontation
with a Hand patrol.

This is a cooperative game. The final score reflects all the players' resources
that made it successfully to the Night Market entrance.

# Setup

To build the board, run `rake db:seed`.
